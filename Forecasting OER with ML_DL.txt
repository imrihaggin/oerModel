A Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approach to Forecasting Owners' Equivalent Rent




Deconstructing Owners' Equivalent Rent: The Forecasting Target


A robust forecasting model for any economic variable must begin with a granular understanding of the target series' construction. The Owners' Equivalent Rent of Primary Residence (OER) component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a particularly nuanced measure. Its methodology, designed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), introduces structural lags and smoothing that are critical to acknowledge. Forecasting OER is not a matter of predicting a real-time market price, but rather of predicting the output of a complex, multi-stage measurement process.


The Rental Equivalence Principle


The conceptual foundation of OER is the "rental equivalence" approach [1]. The BLS aims to measure the change in the cost of shelter services consumed by homeowners. Rather than adopting a "user cost" approach, which would attempt to aggregate expenses like mortgage interest, property taxes, and insurance, the BLS estimates the implicit rent a homeowner would have to pay to rent their own home [1, 2, 3]. This methodological choice anchors the OER index directly to the rental market, making rental data the primary input for its price changes.
The weight or relative importance of OER within the broader CPI basket is determined through the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Homeowners are asked a hypothetical question: "If someone were to rent your home today, how much do you think it would rent for monthly, unfurnished and without utilities?" [3, 4, 5]. The responses to this question establish OER's substantial expenditure weight, which is larger than that of the direct Rent of Primary Residence index because there are more homeowners than renters and the average implied rent for owned homes is higher [4]. However, it is a critical and often misunderstood point that this survey determines only the weighting of OER. The month-to-month price changes that drive the index are not based on this hypothetical question; instead, they are imputed from a sample of actual, tenant-occupied rental units [4, 6].


The Six-Panel Survey Structure: The Source of Inherent Lag


The most significant structural feature of the OER index—and the primary source of its lag relative to market conditions—is its data collection methodology. The BLS Housing Survey divides its sample of rental units into six distinct panels [7]. Each month, BLS field staff collect rent data for only one of these six panels. This means that any given rental unit in the sample is priced only once every six months [2, 6, 7].
The pricing schedule is staggered throughout the year: Panel 1 is surveyed in January and July, Panel 2 in February and August, and so on for all six panels [7]. The monthly OER index is then calculated as a weighted average of the six-month price changes observed in the current month's panel. Consequently, any given monthly release of the OER index is a composite figure where only one-sixth of the underlying data reflects current price changes. The remaining five-sixths of the data are stale, reflecting price changes from one to five months prior. This process acts as a powerful six-month moving average filter, mechanically smoothing the index and ensuring that it will respond to turning points in the real-world rental market with a considerable and predictable delay.
This construction means that the official OER series is, by design, always looking in the rearview mirror. A sudden shock or acceleration in market rents for new leases will not be fully reflected in the OER index for many months. It must gradually filter through the six panels as each one is repriced. This creates a structural, not merely correlational, lead-lag relationship between real-time market rent indicators and the official OER measure, a property that is central to any effective forecasting strategy.


Weighting and Imputation: From Rents to OER


The BLS leverages the same sample of rental units to compute the price changes for both the Rent of Primary Residence index and the OER index [1, 2, 7]. The crucial distinction between the two indices lies in the weighting applied to the price changes of these rental units. For the OER index, the sample of renter-occupied units is re-weighted to make it representative of the characteristics of the owner-occupied housing stock [1].
This re-weighting is necessary because the composition of housing differs significantly between owners and renters. For example, owners are more likely to reside in single-family detached (SFD) homes and in different neighborhoods compared to renters [6]. To account for this, the weight of each rental unit is allocated between the renter and owner universes [2]. This ensures that the price changes of rental units that are more similar to the owner-occupied stock (e.g., SFD homes in suburban neighborhoods) are given greater importance in the OER calculation.
In response to research indicating that different property types experience different price trends, the BLS updated its methodology starting in January 2023 [4]. This research concluded that an underrepresentation of SFDs in the sample had the potential to reduce the accuracy of the OER index. The new methodology adjusts the unit-level weights within the OER calculation to better match the SFD and non-SFD mix of owner-occupied homes as reported in the American Community Survey (ACS) [4]. This explicit adjustment underscores the BLS's effort to impute the cost of owned housing from a sample that does not perfectly mirror it.


Adjustments and Data Processing


Before the final index is computed, the raw contract rent data collected from the panels undergoes several adjustments to ensure consistency and accuracy:
* Quality Adjustments: The BLS accounts for changes in the quality of the housing unit or the services provided by the landlord. For instance, if a landlord stops including electricity in the rent, a positive adjustment is made to the current rent to make it comparable to the previous period's data, which included that service [2, 6]. This produces what is termed the "economic rent."
* Utility Adjustments: The OER concept is based on an unfurnished rental without utilities. Therefore, for the OER calculation, the BLS estimates the value of any utilities provided by the landlord and subtracts this cost from the economic rent. The resulting figure is referred to as "pure rent" [1].
* Age-Bias Factor: Because each housing unit is six months older every time it is surveyed, a statistical adjustment known as an "age-bias factor" is applied to account for the effects of aging on a property's rental value [2, 6].
These deterministic, process-driven steps introduce further friction and potential noise between the "true" market rent for an equivalent property and the final reported OER figure. A successful forecasting model must therefore account for the entire data collection and aggregation pipeline. The task is not merely to forecast the housing market in an economic sense, but to forecast the output of the BLS's specific, and at times bureaucratic, measurement methodology.


Feature Engineering for OER Forecasting: Identifying the Leading Indicators


Having deconstructed the OER index, the next step is to engineer a feature set that captures its key drivers and structural properties. The inherent lags in the OER calculation mean that several high-frequency data series serve as powerful leading indicators. A sophisticated feature set will incorporate these primary housing market drivers alongside broader macroeconomic variables that provide essential context.


Primary Drivers: High-Frequency Housing Market Data


The most potent predictors for OER are real-time measures of the housing market that are not subject to the BLS's six-month panel smoothing. These indicators capture price dynamics at the margin, which eventually feed into the broader, slower-moving official statistics.
* New-Tenant Rent Indices: These are the most critical leading indicators as they directly measure the variable OER seeks to approximate. The Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI) is a prominent example, tracking the asking rents for newly available units [8, 9]. Because the OER measures rents for all tenants (new and continuing), and most tenants are on existing leases that are repriced infrequently, changes in the new-tenant market take time to pass through to the entire rental stock. Empirical research, including analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, has robustly established that ZORI inflation leads OER inflation by approximately 12 months [10]. Other similar indices, such as the CoreLogic Single-Family Rent Index (SFRI) and the Cleveland Fed's New Tenant Repeat Rent Index (NTRR), confirm this lead time of roughly four quarters [10, 11].
* House Price Indices: The growth in house prices also serves as a strong leading indicator for OER, though the causal mechanism is more indirect and the lead time is slightly longer. Key indices include the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index and the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) [12]. Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas found that house price growth (year-over-year) is most strongly correlated with OER inflation 16 months later, with a peak correlation coefficient of 0.75 [12]. Rising home prices can influence rents through several channels: they can increase demand for rental housing by making homeownership less affordable, and they can signal to landlords that the market can sustain higher rents. For real-time forecasting, the ZHVI is often preferred over the Case-Shiller index. The ZHVI uses a hedonic methodology and is calculated daily, making it significantly more timely than the Case-Shiller's repeat-sales methodology, which has a substantial publication lag [13].
The predictive power of these alternative housing data series is not constant but rather episodic and regime-dependent. The forecasting advantage of an index like ZORI became most pronounced during the COVID-19 pandemic, when a massive and rapid shock to rental demand caused a historic divergence between new-tenant asking rents and the slow-moving official CPI measures [8, 9]. Before this period of high volatility, when the two series moved more closely together, ZORI offered less incremental predictive information [8]. This suggests that the relationship, or beta, between OER and its leading indicators is not static. A sophisticated forecasting model should account for this potential for regime shifts, perhaps through interaction terms or by using an architecture that can dynamically adjust feature importance based on market context.


Secondary Drivers: Labor Market and Macroeconomic Context


While high-frequency housing data provides the primary signal, broader macroeconomic variables are essential for capturing the underlying demand-side pressures that drive shelter costs.
* Unemployment Rate: The classic Phillips curve framework posits an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation [14]. In the context of housing, a tight labor market (low unemployment) is associated with stronger wage growth and higher rates of household formation. This increases the aggregate demand for housing, exerting upward pressure on both rents and home prices.
* Wage and Income Growth: The capacity of households to pay for shelter is a direct function of their income. Several indicators can capture this dynamic:
   * Average Hourly Earnings (AHE): A high-frequency (monthly) indicator of wage pressures that is closely watched by markets and policymakers [15, 16, 17].
   * Employment Cost Index (ECI): A broader, quarterly measure of labor costs that includes both wages and benefits. It is often considered a cleaner signal of underlying labor cost pressures as it is less susceptible to compositional effects (e.g., shifts in employment between high- and low-wage industries) [18, 19].
   * Real Disposable Personal Income: This measures the after-tax and after-inflation income available to households for spending and saving, providing a comprehensive view of purchasing power.
* Inflation Expectations: In an environment of elevated inflation, expectations of future price growth can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Workers may demand higher wages to preserve their real purchasing power, and landlords may raise rents in anticipation of rising costs and strong nominal income growth [20, 21]. The interaction between a tight labor market and high inflation expectations can create a potent feedback loop that spills over into the shelter component of CPI.
An additional layer of sophistication can be achieved by considering a "bottom-up" forecasting approach. OER is a sub-component of the Shelter index, which in turn is a component of the headline CPI. Research in inflation forecasting has shown that building separate models for individual components and then aggregating their forecasts can often yield more accurate results than modeling the aggregate series directly [22, 23]. Furthermore, advanced deep learning architectures, such as Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks (HRNN), are explicitly designed to leverage the known hierarchical structure of the CPI. These models can use information from higher-level aggregates (e.g., overall Shelter inflation) to improve and stabilize forecasts for more volatile lower-level components like OER [24, 25]. This suggests that a state-of-the-art approach would model the components of the CPI shelter hierarchy jointly, rather than treating OER in isolation.


Data Sourcing and Preparation


A practical implementation requires sourcing these variables and transforming them appropriately. The Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) database is an excellent public source for most macroeconomic series, while housing-specific data can be obtained directly from providers like Zillow.
* Target Variable:
   * Owners' Equivalent Rent of Primary Residence, SA: CUSR0000SEHC01 [26]
* Primary Predictors:
   * Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI): Available from Zillow Research Data portal [27] or third-party platforms like Hugging Face [28].
   * Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI): USAUCSFRCONDOSMSAMID [29]
   * S&P Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index, SA: CSUSHPISA [30]
* Secondary Predictors:
   * Unemployment Rate, SA: UNRATE [31]
   * Average Hourly Earnings of All Employees, Total Private, SA: CES0500000003 [15]
   * Employment Cost Index: Total Compensation, Private Industry, NSA: CIU2010000000000I [19]
All data should be converted to a consistent monthly frequency. The standard transformation for index-level data in this context is the year-over-year percentage change, which helps to achieve stationarity and represents the inflation rate. Crucially, predictor variables must be lagged according to their empirically determined lead times to avoid lookahead bias. For instance, the year-over-year growth of ZORI should be included as a feature lagged by 12 months, while the growth of ZHVI should be lagged by 16 months.
The following table provides a strategic summary of the key leading indicators for building a robust OER forecasting model.

	Lead Time vs. OER
	Rationale & Causal Link
	Zillow Observed Rent Index (ZORI)
	Zillow Research Data [27]

A Spectrum of Sophisticated Forecasting Models


With a well-defined target variable and a curated feature set, the focus shifts to model selection. A range of machine learning and deep learning models are suitable for this task, offering different trade-offs between implementation speed, predictive performance, and interpretability. The choice of model should be guided by the specific goals of the project, balancing the need for a quick solution with the desire for a methodologically impressive and insightful analysis.


Advanced Econometric & Regularized Models (Sophisticated Baselines)


Before deploying more complex non-linear models, it is essential to establish strong baselines using advanced but well-understood econometric techniques. These models provide a benchmark for performance and are often highly interpretable.
* Vector Autoregression (VAR): As a cornerstone of multivariate time series analysis, a VAR model is a natural starting point. It can explicitly model the dynamic interdependencies and feedback loops between OER inflation and its key leading indicators, such as the growth in ZORI and ZHVI. Federal Reserve research has utilized VAR models to capture these very relationships, making it a theoretically sound and respected approach [10, 12]. A well-specified VAR serves as a robust baseline against which more complex machine learning models must demonstrate superior performance.
* LASSO Regression: The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) is a powerful regularized regression technique well-suited for economic forecasting where the number of potential predictors can be large. By applying an $L_1$ penalty to the regression coefficients, LASSO shrinks the coefficients of irrelevant features to exactly zero, thus performing automatic feature selection [33]. This property enhances model interpretability and reduces the risk of overfitting. A recent IMF working paper on inflation forecasting found that LASSO consistently outperformed more complex models, including tree-based ensembles, for short-to-medium term forecasts. The paper highlighted LASSO's ability to produce accurate, stable forecasts while clearly identifying the main economic drivers [33]. This makes LASSO an excellent choice for a model that is both quick to implement and easy to explain.


Ensemble Methods: The Practitioner's Choice (XGBoost)


For achieving high predictive accuracy on tabular and time series data, tree-based ensemble methods have become a dominant force in applied machine learning.
* Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost): XGBoost is an advanced and highly optimized implementation of the gradient boosting algorithm [34]. It builds a predictive model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees, in a sequential fashion. Each new tree is trained to correct the errors of the previous ones.
* Strengths: The primary advantage of XGBoost is its ability to capture complex non-linear relationships and high-order interactions between features automatically, without requiring manual specification [34, 35]. It is computationally efficient, scalable to large datasets, and has robust, mature libraries available in Python and R. Its proven performance across a wide range of forecasting problems has made it a go-to tool for practitioners [36, 37].
* Considerations: A key challenge with tree-based models in a time series context is their potential to overfit, particularly when the underlying data distribution shifts. The previously mentioned IMF study noted that tree-based models, trained on a long period of stable, low inflation, performed poorly in predicting the subsequent inflation surge, as they had essentially learned the historical mean and were unable to extrapolate [33]. This underscores the critical importance of using a robust time series cross-validation scheme (e.g., a rolling-window forecast evaluation) and careful hyperparameter tuning to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.


Deep Learning for Sequential Data (LSTMs & GRUs)


Deep learning offers architectures specifically designed to model sequential data, making them a natural candidate for time series forecasting.
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Architectures like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) are purpose-built for learning from sequences. They maintain an internal "memory" or hidden state that is updated at each time step, allowing them to capture temporal dependencies in the data [38, 39, 40].
* Performance in Literature: The academic literature on using LSTMs for macroeconomic forecasting presents a mixed and evolving picture. Some studies have demonstrated that LSTMs can outperform traditional econometric models and simpler neural networks, particularly for longer forecast horizons or during periods of heightened economic uncertainty, where their ability to capture non-linear dynamics is most valuable [38, 41]. However, other recent and rigorous studies have found that LSTMs do not consistently outperform simpler, more robust baselines like SARIMA or LASSO regression for inflation forecasting [42, 43]. These models can be notoriously difficult to tune, computationally expensive to train, and are prone to overfitting, especially given the relatively small number of observations (typically a few hundred monthly data points) available for most macroeconomic time series [24, 25].


The State-of-the-Art: Transformer Architectures (TFT)


A more recent and highly promising deep learning architecture for time series is the Transformer, which has been adapted from its origins in natural language processing.
* Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT): The TFT is a novel architecture designed by Google researchers specifically for multi-horizon time series forecasting. It combines the strengths of several advanced techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance while, crucially, also providing a high degree of interpretability [44].
* Key Architectural Features: The TFT's power stems from its sophisticated architecture, which includes:
   1. Gated Residual Networks (GRNs): These act as flexible building blocks that allow the model to skip over unused components of the architecture, effectively adapting its complexity to the dataset at hand [44].
   2. Variable Selection Networks (VSNs): These networks are applied to the input features to learn which variables are most important for the prediction task, providing a direct measure of feature importance [44].
   3. Interpretable Multi-Head Self-Attention: This is the core mechanism of the Transformer. It allows the model to learn long-range temporal dependencies by calculating attention weights that signify the importance of past time steps when making a forecast for a future point. Unlike in RNNs, this mechanism is not susceptible to vanishing gradients over long sequences [44, 45].
* The Interpretability Advantage: The most compelling feature of the TFT in an economic forecasting context is its built-in explainability. Most deep learning models are treated as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand the rationale behind their predictions. The TFT is designed to overcome this. It can output the learned importance of each input variable and, through its attention mechanism, can visualize which historical time periods were most influential for a given forecast [44]. This allows the forecaster to construct a compelling economic narrative around the model's output (e.g., "The model is revising its OER forecast upwards because its attention mechanism is focused on the sustained acceleration in house price growth 16 months ago"). This capability directly addresses the need for a model that is not just accurate, but also impressive and defensible.
The choice among these models illustrates a common trade-off in applied machine learning. For a project where the primary goal is to quickly generate a high-performing forecast, XGBoost offers an excellent balance of power and practicality. However, for a project where the narrative, economic intuition, and explanation of the forecast are as critical as the numerical prediction itself, the Temporal Fusion Transformer is a demonstrably superior and more sophisticated choice. Ultimately, no single model is guaranteed to be optimal under all market conditions. The finding that tree-based models can struggle after long periods of stability and the mixed results for LSTMs suggest that model performance is highly context-dependent. Therefore, a robust forecasting process should involve a "horse race" between several well-specified candidate models, with the potential to average their forecasts to produce a more stable and reliable prediction [37].
The following table provides a comparative analysis to aid in model selection, evaluating each option across the key dimensions of predictive power, interpretability, and implementation complexity.

Practical Implementation Roadmap and Model Selection


This section provides a concrete, actionable plan for building, evaluating, and selecting an OER forecasting model. It translates the preceding analysis of data and models into a tiered implementation strategy, allowing for a choice based on the desired balance between speed and sophistication.


The Implementation Workflow


A rigorous and reproducible forecasting process follows a standard workflow. Adherence to these steps is crucial for producing a reliable model and avoiding common pitfalls in time series analysis.
1. Step 1: Data Aggregation and Preparation. The initial step involves consolidating all time series identified in Table 1 from their respective sources (e.g., FRED, Zillow). All data must be aligned to a common monthly frequency, handling any missing values appropriately. The primary transformation for all index-level data will be the calculation of year-over-year percentage changes. Finally, the crucial step of creating lagged features must be performed, shifting the predictor variables back in time according to their established lead times (e.g., a 12-month lag for ZORI growth).
2. Step 2: Time Series Cross-Validation. A simple train-test split is invalid for time series data as it ignores the temporal ordering and can lead to lookahead bias. The industry standard for robust backtesting is to use a rolling-window (or expanding-window) cross-validation scheme. This process simulates real-world forecasting by iteratively training the model on a window of past data and generating a forecast for the next step, then sliding the window forward one period and repeating. This ensures that the model is always evaluated on "unseen" future data, providing a realistic estimate of its out-of-sample performance [46].
3. Step 3: Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning. For any chosen model, performance is highly dependent on its hyperparameters (e.g., the number of trees in XGBoost, the learning rate in a neural network). These parameters should not be set arbitrarily. A systematic search, such as a grid search or a more efficient Bayesian optimization, should be performed within the time series cross-validation loop to identify the optimal hyperparameter configuration that minimizes the out-of-sample forecast error [47].
4. Step 4: Evaluation and Interpretation. Model performance should be evaluated on the out-of-sample forecasts generated during cross-validation using standard regression metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Beyond quantitative metrics, a critical part of the evaluation is generating model explanations. This step moves beyond simply producing a number to understanding why the model is making its predictions.


Tier 1 Strategy (Quick & Powerful): XGBoost


This strategy prioritizes delivering a high-performance model with the best return on time invested. It is the recommended path for a rapid yet robust initial implementation.
* Implementation: The workflow can be executed efficiently using standard Python data science libraries. Data manipulation can be handled with pandas, preprocessing and cross-validation with scikit-learn, and model training with the xgboost library [34]. The ecosystem for these tools is mature, with extensive documentation and community support.
* Interpretability: While XGBoost is not inherently as interpretable as a linear model, powerful post-hoc explanation techniques exist. The SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library is the state-of-the-art method for explaining the output of any machine learning model. After training, SHAP values can be calculated to generate feature importance plots, showing which variables had the largest impact on the model's predictions on average. More granularly, SHAP dependence plots can be used to explain individual forecasts, allowing for a narrative such as, "The model's forecast for next month increased by 0.1 percentage points, with the largest positive contribution coming from the sustained high value of the 12-month lagged ZORI growth feature."


Tier 2 Strategy (Highly Sophisticated & Impressive): Temporal Fusion Transformer


This strategy prioritizes methodological sophistication, deep insights, and explainability. It is the recommended path for producing a state-of-the-art analysis designed to showcase advanced capabilities.
* Implementation: Implementing a TFT is a more involved process that requires a deep learning framework like PyTorch or TensorFlow. However, high-level libraries such as pytorch-forecasting have emerged to significantly abstract away the complexity. These libraries provide a dedicated TFT model class and data structures that streamline the process of preparing data and training the model [44]. The data must be carefully structured into static inputs (features that do not change over time), known future inputs (features whose future values are known, e.g., day of the week), and observed past inputs (the lagged macroeconomic variables).
* Interpretability: The key advantage of this approach is leveraging the TFT's built-in interpretability mechanisms [44]. The implementation libraries provide simple function calls to extract and plot these insights. One can plot the variable selection weights to produce a ranked list of the most important features as determined by the model itself. Most impressively, one can visualize the self-attention weights. This produces a heat map showing, for a specific forecast point, which historical time steps the model was "paying the most attention to," providing a powerful and intuitive explanation for its temporal reasoning.


Final Recommendations


The selection of a final strategy depends on the precise balance of project constraints and objectives.
For the stated goal of quickly building a sophisticated model that is not necessarily perfect, the Tier 1 XGBoost strategy is the most pragmatic and highly recommended starting point. It leverages a proven, high-performance algorithm that can be implemented efficiently, and when paired with SHAP for explanations, it produces a powerful and defensible forecasting tool.
To fully achieve the objective of creating a model that is uniquely "impressive," the recommended approach is to pursue a two-stage plan. First, implement the Tier 1 XGBoost model to rapidly establish a strong, accurate baseline forecast. This demonstrates practical execution and delivers immediate value. Second, leverage this baseline to propose the development of a Tier 2 Temporal Fusion Transformer model as a next-generation enhancement. This dual approach showcases both immediate results and a forward-looking strategic vision. Presenting the architectural advantages of the TFT, particularly its superior, built-in interpretability, will demonstrate a deep and nuanced command of modern quantitative forecasting techniques, setting the analysis apart from standard approaches.
